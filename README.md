HRSuite
=======
This is a real basic HR application.

To start, we'regoing to just have Info, Roles, and Benefits (Pay (maybe))

Employee
- ID
- InfoID
- RoleID

EmployeeInfo
- ID
- FirstName
- MiddleName
- LastName
- DOB (Birthday)
- Phone
- Address
- SSN

Role
- ID
- Name
- Manager (bool)
- Level (string)


I might be a retard, but this is the model that I'm going with so far. 

I'm using .NET 4.5 (or higher, can't tell?), MVC, with Entity Framework (for scaffolding)

Let's rock this shit.
